## Fundamental Algorithms - Homeworks
My homeworks, in the form they were handled in, for the Fundamental Algorithms course
  - Famous algorithms implemented in C++
  - Checking big O, sometimes by generating Excel file, sometimes by using the Profiler given to us
  - Personal interpretations, and the usual amount of (attempts of) humor
