 *
 * Theme: Depth- First Search, Topological Sort, Tarjan's algorithm
 *
 *
 * Explanations, notes for future me:
 *
 *  Depth- first search
 *   - well-known algorithm
 *   - it uses a stack
 *   - in this implementation, it is recursive => it uses the default stack
 *
 *  Topological sort
 *   - ex: an order in which tasks can be made
 *       - tasks rely on each other
 *       - arcs show this dependence (a->b => a has to be made before b)
 *
 *   - by looking at end times of nodes being processed in a graph, in reverse order,
 *     we can find a possible topological order
 *   - algorithm takes DFS and stores nodes when processing is done
 *   - at the end it prints nodes in reverse order
 *   - if there are cycles, there is no topological order (it introduces a paradox)
 *
 *   - NOTE: the algorithm does not run in infinite loop if there is a cycle, since it
 *       checks the colors, but the outcome is not a solution, since there is no
 *       valid solution for such graphs. I chose to print the outcome anyways, and
 *       notify the user that the graph has a cycle. It could be easily modified by
 *       de-commenting the lines marked with (*) so that the algorithm stops at the
 *       first cycle and does not print the (otherwise useless) outcome
 *
 *  Tarjan's algorithm
 *   - goal: find strongly connected components
 *
 *   - approach: further augmenting the node structure : we have an index and a low-link
 *   - when we run Tarjan, we focus on the indexes of nodes - the time they were first processed by DFS
 *       - like starting time but since we have no end time, it is incremented only when nodes are being
 *         processed, while in DFS/topological, we incremented when nodes turned black as well
 *   - "The low-link value of a node is the smallest node ID reachable from that node when doing
 *      a depth-first search (DFS), including itself"
 *       - this will not result in one strongly connected component having same low-link for each of its nodes!
 *           - highlighting the part "when doing a depth-first search" - nodes are processed only once
 *       - it will rather result in an interesting behavior, giving us the result
 *   - in each strongly connected component, at the end, we will have one node with its key equal to its low-link
 *       - except when a node connects to an already processed SCC (meaning "it can go there, but can't come back")
 *           - we address this particular case by ignoring elements which are already processed (black),
 *              but in other component
 *           - this is where the implementation with stack comes in handy
 *
 *   - final implementation:
 *       - we run DFS, putting nodes in a stack and updating low-links
 *       - when we encounter a black node with its index and low-link equal, we pop the elements (from the stack)
 *          until we meet this node
 *
 *   - why DFS is not enough to find strongly connected components? well it just "flows" in one direction, it
 *      does not check if we can get back as well; in one connected component there may be several strongly
 *      connected components
 *
 *
 * Complexity: from the values given from running the evaluation, it is obvious that in both cases (when
 *  varying number of arcs and when varying the nodes) we got a linear complexity. These complexities
 *  should be added up instead of getting multiplied, for similar reasons as in BFS: the two dominant
 *  parts of operation, giving the previously mentioned complexities, are not embedded in each other,
 *  they come one after the other (first nodes are processed, then edges are processed, each one only once).
 *
 * In conclusion, the complexity is O(V+E)
